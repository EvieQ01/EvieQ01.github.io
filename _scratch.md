## A memoir for the first semester of my junior yearðŸ¤£
> ## Introâ€¦
>
> * Heard from a friend that he was admitted to MIT. Material Science P.h.D. I felt happy for him!
> * Compared with receiving an offer, what I wished more for is finding the field of study that I love, just like him, although he joked that his major is one of â€™The-4-Pitfallsâ€™.

	From 2021/07, the moment I decided in an instance, jumped onto my bike,  rushed through the campus, knocked on that door, stepped into Mr.Longâ€™s office,  I knew that my life has been on a new track.

### 1. Research
### 2. Person I met
	Grateful that, I can get to know them.
	* Mrs. Wang
	Sheâ€™s the one who can actually look through me, and offer me advise 	that I needed the most.
	When she asked, *what kind of person you want to become*? I stumbled,  hearing my self saying I donâ€™t know. But she spoke, â€˜You do know,. ::You want to be an interesting one:: â€™
	* Mr. Fan
	* Mr. Long
	* â€¦â€¦	ï¼ˆsenior Zhangjie Cao, senior Yang Shu, senior Ximei Wang, senior Junguang Jiang, senior Haiku Wu, senior Kaichao Youâ€¦ï¼‰
	Meeting these legendary people, was like a dream to me. Like finally meeting my stars hhh.

	* Finally, on that stage
	* ![]()
